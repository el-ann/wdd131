            <h2>How can I create and maintain protective styles for my natural hair?</h2>
            <p>To create protective styles like braids, twists, or cornrows, start by washing and conditioning your hair. Use a leave-in conditioner and shea butter to lock in moisture. When wearing the style, avoid making it too tight to prevent damage. Maintain it by moisturizing regularly with natural oils like coconut or palm kernel oil, wearing a satin scarf or bonnet at night, and keeping your scalp clean.</p>
